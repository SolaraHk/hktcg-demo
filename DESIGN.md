# HKTCG Design System

## Style Prompt

Build a full-screen architectural retail film that carries the visitor through HKTCG as one controlled camera journey. The real store is the visual language: illuminated card walls, people crossing the entrance, white display plinths, mirrored ceilings, and the suspended translucent plaque T. Typography behaves like bold Hong Kong wayfinding and trading-card packaging. The experience is cinematic and precise, but human activity keeps it welcoming rather than luxury-cold.

## Colors

- **Signal Red** — `oklch(0.586 0.235 22.2)` / reference `#E21B3C`. Brand fields, architectural transitions, the T, large display emphasis, and focus indicators.
- **Deep Trading Red** — `oklch(0.49 0.205 22.2)`. Accessible small red text and pressed states on light surfaces.
- **Obsidian** — `oklch(0.147 0.009 270)` / reference `#0B0C0F`. Opening threshold, primary text, and dark cinematic surfaces.
- **Architectural White** — `oklch(0.971 0.004 106)` / reference `#F5F6F4`. Main gallery surface and light text on Obsidian.
- **Cool Silver** — `oklch(0.829 0.009 255)` / reference `#C7CBD0`. Secondary rules, subdued labels, and structural wayfinding.
- **White Surface** — `oklch(0.995 0.002 106)`. Elevated light copy surfaces over media when needed.

Use a committed strategy: red owns decisive actions and the T statement, while Obsidian and Architectural White structure the page around the film. Never wash the entire page red, and never use gray text directly on red.

## Typography

- **Display and wayfinding:** Barlow Condensed, weights 600–800. Short headlines, chapter names, navigation, CTAs, and large statements. Uppercase is reserved for short phrases.
- **Body and bilingual copy:** Chiron Hei HK, weights 400–600. English and Traditional Chinese prose, practical information, and interface text.
- **Fallbacks:** `Arial Narrow`, `Helvetica Neue`, `PingFang HK`, `Microsoft JhengHei`, sans-serif.
- Hero display: fluid `clamp(3.6rem, 7.2vw, 6rem)`, line-height `0.92–0.98`, letter spacing no tighter than `-0.035em`.
- Section display: fluid `clamp(2.6rem, 5vw, 5rem)`.
- Body: `1rem–1.125rem`, line-height `1.5–1.65`, maximum measure `65ch`.
- Small uppercase labels use `0.06em–0.1em` tracking; do not repeat labels above every section.

## Layout

- Opening composition: edge-to-edge store film with independent semantic HTML copy placed directly in the scene. Use localized edge and lower-third scrims only where copy needs contrast; never reserve a permanent split panel.
- Use a 4px spacing base with `8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96` increments and fluid section spacing through `clamp()`.
- The cinematic walkthrough uses a sticky `100svh` stage inside an approximately `480svh` desktop / `400svh` mobile native-scroll section. Scroll position maps to authored film time through narrative keyframes, dwelling on the plaque T and moving quickly through handheld turns. No wheel hijacking or hard scroll snap.
- Keep an always-available route out: “Skip walkthrough.” Primary action: “Plan your visit.”
- After the walkthrough, return to normal document flow for Visit, Play, Trade/Grade/Consign, Events, specialist stores, Shop, hours, and directions.
- Avoid repeated equal cards. Prefer full-width chapters, paired media/copy compositions, lists, rails, and architectural rules.

## Signature Components

### Cinematic Threshold

The store entrance fills the viewport. A restrained bottom scrim supports the line “Walk inside HKTCG” while the real camera crosses the threshold. A slim progress line, scroll prompt, and visible skip control are the only persistent walkthrough controls.

### Red T Reveal

The emotional midpoint. Approach the plaque sculpture as abstraction, then align to its recognizable T sightline. Dim the surrounding frame while preserving the real red plaques. Reveal the semantic HTML line in two beats: “The T stands for” then “Trading.” Reduced motion shows the final photograph and complete sentence immediately.

### Practical Actions

Rectangular, direct buttons with minimal rounding (`0–4px`). Primary actions use Signal Red with Obsidian text or Obsidian with Architectural White text. Hover and focus invert color or move a directional arrow; no wide soft shadows.

## Motion

- One genuine continuous take from the 4K60 store footage. It crosses the entrance, approaches the plaque T, follows the card walls, reaches the service counter, and finishes among the main-floor trading tables. There are no dissolves, generated inserts, still-image dollies, or scene teleports.
- Scroll position controls authored film time. Narrative keyframes hold around the T and card wall, then compress the source's fastest turns so motion blur never becomes the subject.
- The desktop and mobile films share the same uninterrupted take and timing: 16:9 at `1440×810` and a consistent 9:16 crop at `720×1280`. Both are H.264, muted, BT.709, fast-start, and GOP 6 for responsive seeking.
- Continuous progress writes video time, progress, and moment CSS custom properties inside one `requestAnimationFrame`; React state does not update during scrolling.
- Preferred easing: ease-out-expo `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` and ease-out-quint `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`.
- Interaction feedback: `100–250ms`; hero/scene entrances: `500–800ms`.
- No autoplay audio. Owner narration, if exposed, is user-initiated and captioned.

## Responsive Behavior

- Mobile uses a consistent portrait-safe crop of the same take so the route, pace, and spatial continuity stay identical. Copy sits in the lower third while the entrance, plaque T, card walls, counter, and trading floor remain legible.
- Use the dedicated portrait master and portrait posters. Never request both desktop and mobile films.
- Shorten the pinned scroll distance to about `400svh` and keep the skip control visible on touch devices.
- All controls are at least 44×44px and do not depend on hover.
- Respect safe-area insets and mobile browser chrome with `svh`/`dvh` units.
- Reduced motion, slow connections, and data-saver use full-height semantic poster chapters in normal document flow instead of a frozen sticky film.

## Accessibility

- WCAG 2.2 AA contrast and focus visibility.
- The stable walkthrough summary is semantic HTML; transient visual statements are decorative to assistive technology.
- Preserve keyboard order, browser zoom, native scrolling, and a visible skip link.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` removes the sticky film and camera travel while preserving the three key statements as full-height poster scenes.
- Captions and a text transcript are required for any owner video.

## What NOT to Do

- No montage pretending to be a continuous walk. The scroll-controlled master must remain one real take, use dense seek keyframes, and compress its blurred turns through authored scroll timing.
- No split-screen chapter rail, permanent opaque copy panel, or card-based walkthrough UI.
- No free-roam 3D store as the primary experience.
- No neon gamer/cyberpunk styling, franchise fan art, or simulated card-game UI.
- No beige/cream body background, editorial serif styling, gradient text, glass cards, or decorative grid overlays.
- No repeated rounded SaaS cards, ghost-card shadows, or 32px section radii.
- No unverified “world's largest,” square-footage, investment, collection-value, or financial-return claims.
- Do not literalize preview defects such as clipped headline text or exact desktop geometry on mobile.
